## About Me

I'm currently a senior at Iowa State University studying Data Science with an emphasis in Statistics. Most recently, I worked at Colorado State University as a research assistant in the Department of Biology over the summer of 2022. Working with scientists and using data from research conducted in the South Caucasus, I performed initial data cleaning and assisting with exploratory data analysis. Upon graduation in the Spring of 2023, I would like to pursue a career as a Data Scientist and work in a natural science-related field where I can use my skill set and passion to improve the world around me.
